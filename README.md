VIM Config
==========

This is my vim config containing all the settings and plugins (via Vundle) I use.

Install
-------

To install, first clone this repository into the `.vim` directory inside your home folder:
```
git clone https://git.onvori.com/alex/vim.git ~/.vim
```

Next, clone the Vundle repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Finally, open vim and type `:PluginInstall` to install the plugins.


#### Note
For the best experience the terminal colors have to be set up correctly.
To do this, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ajh17/Spacegray.vim#terminal-environment)
for the `spacegrey` color scheme used here.
